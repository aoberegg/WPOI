A weather context aware algorithm incorporated in MyMediaLite. (Zeno Gantner, Steffen Rendle, Christoph Freudenthaler, Lars Schmidt-Thieme:
MyMediaLite: A Free Recommender System Library. RecSys 2011)

The WPOI algorithm is implemented in:
WPOI/src/MyMediaLite/RatingPrediction/WeatherContextAwareItemRecommender.cs

An example how to use it can be found in:
WPOI/examples/csharp/TestMediaLite/TestMediaLite/rating_prediction.cs

Note that the algorithm is just runable when included in MyMediaLite (https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite).
